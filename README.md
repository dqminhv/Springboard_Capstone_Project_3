# CareerVillage Questions Matching Recommendation System
## Problem Statement
CareerVillage.org, a non-profit dedicated to career guidance, seeks to elevate its platform by implementing a data-driven recommendation system. This system will match student queries with the most appropriate volunteers, fostering connections between aspiring minds and experienced professionals. The project uses powerful data science techniques to optimize engagement and ensure students receive relevant, valuable advice from motivated mentors. This initiative holds the potential to significantly enhance CareerVillage's impact, empowering underserved youth with essential career role models.

The CareerVillage Question Recommendation Model is designed to efficiently connect students with professionals by assigning a career-related question to a set of professionals most likely to answer. 

## Methodology
When it comes to recommending new content, there are three main types of systems at play: Content-based Filtering, Collaborative Filtering, and Hybrid Approach. 
For privacy concerns, usersâ€™ information, such as personal and usage information, is neither stored nor utilized for training purposes. Consequently, a content-based approach will be employed for this project.
